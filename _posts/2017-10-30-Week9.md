## What did you do this past week?
This past week I attended an extra credit session for my online course and was broadcast live to several hundred of my peers. I also took the Amazon Software Development Intern Assessment, and had a final round phone interview with Uber. I received an internship offer from one of my top picks, Salesforce (yay!), and attended a recruiting dinner with Thomson Reuters. I had a call with a my potential manager at Salesforce, which went very well! I also completed the OOP project, and prepared for and attended a scary movie night on Friday. On Saturday I attended HackTX and went out to dinner with my family and girlfriend. On Sunday I got to spectate my sister as she completed her first Iron(Wo)Man 70.3! I had a great time watching her and running around taking pictures.

## What's in your way?
I'm in somewhat of a weird spot with my mental health right now, as I just had a lot of stress and pressure relieved with the end of a two-week spurt of very busy activity. I'm enjoying having a bit of free time, but am not quite sure what to do with my time now that I'm not busy 24/7. I really want to start pursuing some of my hobbies again, like running, photography, and exploring the great outdoors.

## What will you do next week?
This next week I will juggle internship offers, and try to determine what the best course for my future is. I'll study for an take a Big Data test Tuesday morning. I will also conduct design doc interviews for CS439 for 5 hours on Tuesday and 5 hours on Thursday. I'll also start working on/designing a solution for the OOP Project.

## What's my experience of the class?
The class has continued to be interesting for me, and I think in some aspects it has been getting easier. Either I'm getting better at thinking about object-oriented concepts, or the content in the course has changed into material I have had more exposure to. I think it's likely a combination of the two.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is [this article](https://www.wired.com/story/i-forgot-my-pin-an-epic-tale-of-losing-dollar30000-in-bitcoin/?mbid=synd_digg) about a guy who stored bitcoin on a hardware wallet and proceeded to lose the credentials he need to access his bitcoin. What follows is an epic tale of rabbit-holes and security exploits in his attempts to recover his lost fortune. He initially bought $3,000 in 2016, which was worth approximately $32,000 by the end of the saga.
