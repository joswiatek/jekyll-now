## What did you do this past week?
This past week I studied for and took an Algorithms exam, registered for HackTX, proctored an OS exam, attended an extra credit lecture, had a call with a recruiter, got a haircut, studied for and took a Business Law exam, had a phone screen with Uber, scheduled travel accomodations with two separate companies, traveled to San Francisco, and had an onsite with SalesForce. I did some sightseeing in San Francisco on Friday and Saturday, then traveled to Mountain View to prepare for an interview with Quora on Monday.

## What's in your way?
Nothing is currently standing in my way. I managed to get enough work done this week before going out of town that I can easily manage everything I need to get done. I would like to spend more time attending Ultimate practice, but there hasn't been enough time in the day.

## What will you do next week?
This next week I will travel back to Austin and lead the grading of an OS project. I will dedicate a decent chunk of time to studying for the upcoming OOP test to ensure that I am adequately prepared. I will also attend an Jazz concert Tuesday evening for my Jazz Appreciation course.

## What's my experience of the class?
I have been enjoying the course. This past week I especially enjoyed exploring the concept of templating in C++. Being able to identify analogs to other languages helped deepen my understanding of both C++, and other OO languages like Java and Python. I think I want to take a Programming Languages course in order to explore these concepts in the general case, outside of the confines of a language.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week is to use Apple Wallet (or whatever the analogous tool is on Android) to store mobile boarding passes whenever flying. Mobile boarding passes eliminate the need to keep track of a piece of paper when going through security and boarding. Rather than having to keep a paper boarding pass handy, you can just scan the QR code directly off your phone, saving time and paper.
