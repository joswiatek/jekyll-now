## What did you do this past week?
This past week was a fairly light week with two projects due: one computer vision and one natural language processing. Both took a good amount of time, but I was able to get both done without too trouble. I also attended the Project Giving Tree Senior Send Off dinner at Fogo de Chao and won a surprising amount of raffle prizes (I just put all my tickets in the most empty cups!). I also played in two IM ultimate games and did an escape room with some close friends as a late birthday celebration.

## What's in your way?
Nothing is in my way. I feel energized and invigorated and ready to go. I had a nice fun weekend spending time bonding with friends and now it's time to get to work.

## What will you do next week?
This next week I will finish this phase of IDB and attend classes as per the norm. I don't have any conflicting projects to work on, so I don't imagine having too much trouble getting the work done. I'm also making plans to see Endgame and spend some time at Austin Beer Garden Brewing Co (gotta use those raffle prizes!)

## What was your experience in learning about refactoring?
I honestly didn't really enjoy the lectures over refactoring. I think the content is important and extremely relevant to software engineering, but I don't think it warranted as much lecture time as it was given. I think the major points could have been covered in one or two lectures and class time could have been allocated to other more interesting topics.

## What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week is a very cool project called [Gource](https://gource.io/) that visualizes project histories as a animated tree. Developers fly around and make commits by sending flashes of light to the files being updated or added, and it's a really cool way to see how a project develops. There's lots of options to adjust the playback speed, user images, timestamps, etc, and it just reads from the git log, so there's nothing you have to set up!
