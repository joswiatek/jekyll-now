## What did you do this past week?
This past week I drove my roommate to the airport, went to an officer meeting and a general meeting, got a flu shot, did stack checks for CS439, started the OOP project, attended a Pancake night, held office hours, went camping, and participated in an outreach program called Kids Who Code. I also attended classes and completed regular weekly assignments.

## What's in your way?
Exhaustion and lack of sleep are starting to catch up with me. I've been neglecting my health a bit (diet and exercise) in order to stay on top of everything in my life. My busy schedule has also been putting stress on my relationships, so I need to revaluate and may consider cutting something out. Regardless, I need to work more efficiently so I have time to sleep, exercise, and eat well.

## What will you do next week?
This next week I will complete the OOP project, complete a Google coding sample, complete an Amazon coding assessment, complete a final round interview for Uber, attend normal weekly org meetings, attend classes, and complete normal weekly assignments. I will attend a lecture on Human Mating Behaviors by David Buss, a prominent researcher in the field of Evolutionary Psychology. I will also attend HackTx and support my sister as she completes an Ironman 70.3.

## What's my experience of the class?
I have still been enjoying the class. There seems to be a large focus on technical details of the implementation of C++. This intrigues me as a lot of courses at UT don't go into the minutiae of particular language features. The closest course I have taken so far in this respect is Python with Arthur Peters. While I enjoy exploring these aspects, sometimes I question the practicality of some course content. Exploring language features and walking through logical explanations is a good exercise in understanding software design and OOP programming, but I'm not sure the content itself is particularly relevant.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is [this article](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qv34zb/how-i-socially-engineer-myself-into-high-security-facilities) about how a physical penetration tester was able to socially engineer herself into several client's facilities. It's a quick, light-hearted read, but nonetheless a good reminder that the best software security in the world is useless if you can't protect it physically.
