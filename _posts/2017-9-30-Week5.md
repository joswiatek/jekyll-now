## What did you do this past week?
This past week I had a final round interview for Tableau Software, and phone screens for Quora and Salesforce. All three went well, I am waiting responses from Tableau and Salesforce and have been invited onsite for Quora. My partner and I finished the Voting project, and I spent a good amount of time working on various course projects and homework. The first PintOS project is due next friday (I am a TA for CS439), so I have been donating a lot of my time in office hours. I also had an ultimate tournament scheduled for this weekend, but it was rained out, giving me more time to study for an algorithms test. I also attended bid night for my fraternity, and two birthday parties.

## What's in your way?
My energy and mental health are standing in my way. I only have so many hours of time and energy in every day and once I use that up, it's difficult to continue being productive. My time management skills are excellent (although they can always improve), and the next best way to get more done is to work more effectively. One thing I would like to focus on is eating healthier and getting more regular exercise. I typically eat healthy and exercise 4-5 times a week, but it's one of the first things to go when I get in a time crunch.

## What will you do next week?
This week most of my time will go towards studying for an algorithms test and a business law test. I would like to spend more time on myself and with my girlfriend this week, as I have been grinding through school and recruiting the past several weeks. I will attempt to spend my time more effectively so that I can get to more things that I WANT to do.

## What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class has been relatively the same as previous weeks. I am impressed with the depth of the technical content, and am stimulated by the discussions in class. I am looing forward to getting deeper into OO concepts, as I feel like we have been exploring fundamental concepts for now.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick of the week is [this](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psxasj/3dme/index.php) website, which can turn a picture into a rudimentary 3D model of your face. It works pretty well, and I was able to generate the following model. Details on the project, including the paper and code is available [here](http://aaronsplace.co.uk/papers/jackson2017recon/).
