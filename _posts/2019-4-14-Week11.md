## What did you do this past week?
This past week was fairly busy but full of good things! I attended my classes, played in two IM Ultimate games (won one and tied the other), attended a faculty candidate talk, proctored and graded an exam, completed a tough computer vision assignment, celebrated my girlfriend's birthday over the weekend, and (tried to) run the Longhorn Run! I also spent a good amount of time working on Phase 3 of the IDB project.

## What's in your way?
The busyness of life is the only thing that's in my way. As I get closer to graduation, there seems to be more and more demands on my time: from my girlfriend and a desire to spend time with her to close friends to my roommates, sometimes it can seem like life is tugging in every direction! The next month and a half will be a busy time in my life, and it'll be important that I remain focused and efficient with my time.

## What will you do next week?
Next week I will finish up Phase 3 of the IDB project and get a start on my next computer vision assignment. I'll also take a kinesiology exam on Tuesday. I'll be heading up to Dallas on Friday to spend the Easter weekend with my parents, so I'll look forward to that during the week.

## What was your experience in learning about regular expressions and SQL?
I enjoyed the lectures on regular expressions and SQL. I think that the primer on SQL was useful and came at an apt time during the class. This phase is heavy on backend development (at least for my group) and we've been doing a lot of data wrangling and handling SQL. The regular expression content was useful in that regex is an incredibly powerful and useful tool, but I don't think it will be relevant or useful for the IDB project.

## What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week is [cron](https://opensource.com/article/17/11/how-use-cron-linux). Cron is a linux service that can be used to schedule commands to occur at regular, repeating times. We're using it during this phase to repopulate our database nightly as our models are time sensitive. I think cron is an incredibly useful tool and is one of the lesser known linux services. As explained in the article, it's the perfect tool for scheduling tasks that need to occur at off peak hours or tasks that are repetitive and easy to automate.
