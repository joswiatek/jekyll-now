## What did you do this past week?
This past week was fairly low-stress, although I didn't have much free time. I spent a lot of time doing design doc interviews for OS, but they're fairly straightforward as I've TA'd the class so many times before. I really enjoyed being able to take a "break" from the rush of projects and was able to lift and run a few times. I also attended the "Longhorn Awakening" retreat put on by the University Catholic Center this past weekend. It definitely made an impact on me and reminded me of a part of my life that I was missing and lacking in.

## What's in your way?
I'm starting to have a bit of an issue with motivation for my coursework because I'm getting so close to graduation and post-university life. I know I'll miss my life and friends in Austin, so I want to spend as much time as possible bonding with them before I leave Austin after graduation. I'm still committed to finishing my degree out, but I've also been spending a bit of time considering what's worth it in regards to putting in so many hours studying vs building my relationships with my friends and working on my mental health.

## What will you do next week?
This next week will commence another sprint on the next phase of the SWE project. I also have a fairly large CV assignment due Thursday evening that I haven't really started on yet. My NLP class has another project coming up, so I'll need to start doing some investigatory work for that. I'll also be doing Longhorn Run next weekend, so I'll be doing a final training run early in the week and then tapering down before race day.

## What did you think of the talk by Dr. Rich and Dr. Cline?
I enjoyed the talks by Dr. Rich and Dr. Cline. As mentioned by Dr. Cline himself, I think that our degree plans lacks a substantial ethics requirement and having that injected into our SWE class was definitely beneficial. I think the material presented gave a good overview of ethics given the limited time, and I would have loved to see links or pointers to more resources and readings for interested students.

## What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is [this](https://kevinmartinjose.com/2019/04/08/programming-doing-it-more-vs-doing-it-better/) blog post regarding quantity vs quality in regards to getting better at programming and software engineering. I think that I agree with the author that increasing your speed of development doesn't necessarily lead to improvements in quality. However, I think that his statements can be misleading and that at some level, doing more software engineering with more people will lead to increased exposure to new tools and practices that will improve your software engineering. As with everything in life, there's a fine balance: we should strive to develop quickly, but not so quickly that we make mistakes or sacrifice the ability to retrospect and think critically about our engineering practices.
