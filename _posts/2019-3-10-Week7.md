## What did you do this past week?
I had another hectic, busy week! I attended my classes, finished the first phase of the SWE project, worked on my natural language processing group project, did correctness grading for the class I TA, took an exam, finished and turned in a computer vision assignment, and had another grading meeting for the course I TA. It was a stressful week for me with little downtime, but I got some good R+R this weekend to make up for it!

## What's in your way?
Time management is the constant obstacle! I think I managed everything pretty well this past week, and I have another busy week approaching. Sometimes it's difficult for me to tell if I'm managing my time efficiently, but Google Calendar and Google Keep help me keep track of all my assignments and meetings!

## What will you do next week?
This next week I'll take three exams (Software Engineering, Computer Vision, and Kinesiology). I'll also complete and submit my NLP project. I'm not too concerned as I already feel adequately prepared for my exams and my group has made excellent progress on our project. I'll be spending spring break at a cabin in Oklahoma with some friends, so I'll have that to look forward too at the end of the week!

## What was your experience of Project #2: IDB1?
Overall, I had a positive experience. Everyone in my group is friends and we've known each other for a long time now, so there isn't any friction in communication. We broke up tasks efficiently and helped each other out when we had trouble. We all learned a few new tools and a few new things about the tools we already knew. I'm confident heading into the next phase; I know it'll be a lot of work, but I'm looking forward to creating something great with my team!

## What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week is a book called [The Anatomy of Peace](https://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Peace-Resolving-Heart-Conflict/dp/1626564310). Its a book about conflict in relationships in all aspects of life. I won't give any spoilers, but it really changed the way I think about my interactions with others and the world in general! I would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy but enriching read.
