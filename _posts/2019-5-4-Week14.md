## What did you do this past week?
This past week I attended classes, finished this the visualizations for this last phase, held office hours, taught my last discussion section, worked out several times, went shopping for some hawaiian clothes, and attended an engagement party.

## What's in your way?
Nothing is in my way this coming week. I have three exams, the SWE presentation, and one project due. I feel pretty prepared for the week, and am so close to graduation that it doesn't really matter how things go this week. I am still going to study and try my hardest, but if something goes poorly, it's definitely not the end of the world.

## What will you do next week?
Next week, I will take my three exams, present the final phase of the SWE project, and turn in my project. I will also get a few workouts in and continue to meal prep! Friday is my last day of classes, so I'll likely celebrate with friends in some way.

## What did you think of the talk by Miriam?
I really enjoyed the talk by Miriam. It was really cool to hear her life story and how she was able to find success and overcome the obstacles in her way. Her story was inspiring and it made me think! I think her talk was incredibly enriching and it was one of my favorites. Her comments and lessons on how gender is viewed in the workplace were straightforward and to the point, but also probed some really deep questions and responses. I think she effectively communicated her message without including too many extra details.

## What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/smarter-living/500-days-of-duolingo-what-you-can-and-cant-learn-from-a-language-app.html) from the New York Times about language learning apps. The article details what you can and can't learn from apps, and what you should expect if you start using them. In a nutshell, the article says that apps can be useful for learning new writing systems and basic phrases, but aren't sufficient for really developing fluency in a language. This meshes with the standard refrain I've always heard: the best way to learn a new language is by immersion.
