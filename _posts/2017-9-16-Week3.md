## What did you do this past week?
This past week included a mix of coursework, hosting rush events, organization meetings, and preparing for career fair. I got sick over the weekend, so I had to manage trying to recover before career fair with getting all my work done on time. I completed the Collatz project on Wednesday and submitted it Thursday afternoon between the FoCS brunch, a lecture, career fair, and a coffee night meet & greet.

## What's in your way?
There's nothing standing in my way right now. My weekly schedule has solidified enough that I am confident I have a good feel for when I'll have time to work and therefore, how much I need to progress on certain projects. Google Calendar and Google Keep have been instrumental in helping me keep everything straight and making sure nothing slips through the cracks.

## What will you do next week?
My next week should be fairly relaxed coursework wise, as I have no tests or major projects due. Recruiting will take up a portion of my time, as I already have two technical interviews scheduled and hopefully more to come. Our closed rush starts next week, so that will take up a small portion of my time. I'll likely get a head start on the next project as soon as it is released.

## What's my experience of the class?
I enjoyed the project and the rigorous structure of the workflow. While at times it seemed to slow down progress, it provided a good structure to make steady forward progress. Opening and closing issues to keep track of bugs and the current state of the project was useful, and something that goes on in the workplace as well. The lecture and quiz material has been getting more complex and technical, which is an enjoyable challenge.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is a Chrome extension called [Full Page Screenshot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/full-page-screenshot/glgomjpomoahpeekneidkinhcfjnnhmb?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog). I normally don't like installing Chrome extensions as the number of extensions I install can quickly get out of control and slow down performance, but this one is too useful to pass up. It essentially takes several screnshots of a web page and stitches them together into one seamless image. I used it to screenshot my courses to create a pseudo-unofficial transcript for internship applications.
