## What did you do this past week?
This past week I interviewed with Quora on monday and traveled back to ATX monday night. The rest of the week I caught up on assignments and began grading of design docs to CS439. I also attended the final day of Austin City Limits.

## What's in your way?
Nothing is currently standing in my way. I have a lot of grading to get done but I should have plenty of time to manage it. I have no tests for major projects due for several weeks.

## What will you do next week?
This next week I will do a bunch of grading for CS439 and do stack checks as a progress check for the current OS project. I will hopefully start working on the next OOP project, assuming it is released this week. I will also likely have a final round interview for Uber this week.

## What's my experience of the class?
I have still been enjoying the class. I missed two lectures as I was traveling for interviews, but was able to get caught up through the notes posted online and getting notes/explanations from classmates. The test seemed like a good evaluation of our knowledge of the course material, although the multiple choice questions were a little too specific in my opinion.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week is [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), a terminal multiplexer. It allows you to efficiently manage terminal interactions through sessions, windows, and panes. It has been a lifesaver for grading over ssh, as I need to have 4-6 files and a terminal open at once. Tmux supports this and much more.
