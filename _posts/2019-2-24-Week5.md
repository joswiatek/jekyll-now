## What did you do this past week?
This past week I attended my classes, turned in my first NLP project (whew!), played squash with some buddies, took pictures for a composite, attended bid night, and played in an IM soccer game! Overall, the beginning of the week was a bit stressful leading up to turning my project in, and then pretty light for the second half. I was able to relax and let loose a bit Friday night, and still got some good work done on the weekend. 

## What's in your way?
Nothing major is in my way, except for the shortage of hours in each day! My SWE group is pretty well organized and we're handling the work well so far. None of us are experts in full-stack, but we each have a bit of experience with certain technologies we're using for the project, so we've been able to learn from each other. Next week will be another busy one, so staying organized and efficiently using my time will be critical.

## What will you do next week?
This upcoming week I'll continue to dig into the SWE project. We've already got our domain locked down and have configured our DNS to point to AWS. We hope to have collected our data and designed our front-end by Wednesday, and then will proceed with creating our actual web app and deploying it onto AWS. There is also a CS439 exam on Wednesday that I'll be proctoring, as well as a review session Monday evening. Those two things (mostly the exam) are going to eat up a good chunk of my energy this week, so I'll have to manage around that. I also have a kinesiology test Tuesday and a CV assignment due next-next week that I need to continue working on.

## What did you think of the talk by Ed on GCP and Hannah on AWS?

I enjoyed both talks, although I think the talk by Hannah was much more practical and therefore useful for our projects. We have a bit of experience with cloud and all agreed to use AWS before seeing either presentation, and our opinions didn't change as a result of the talks. I think both platforms are effective, but AWS has a proven track record and I believe has much better support. It seems like GCP is trying too hard to make things easy, and I feel like the platform makes some sacrifices in customizability because of that. I trust that AWS can provide all the services we require, and will have good support/documentation if we run into trouble. I think both Hannah and Ed gave great overviews of the platforms and I liked that Hannah's talk walked through specifics that were applicable to our projects. Ed's talk was great, but seemed like it was structured more as a business proposal than as a presentation to future engineers. 

## What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

My pick-of-the-week is [AWS Educate!](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/) It's Amazon's program for educators and students, and has a lot of really good benefits, including free AWS credits. UT students can get $100 to put towards most AWS services, as well as access to a lot of training courses and collaboration tools. Joining this program would be a great way to cover the costs of your group project if you want to use services above the free tier.
