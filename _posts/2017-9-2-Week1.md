Hello, My name is Joel Swiatek!

Welcome to my first blog post for CS371P Object Oriented Programming with Glenn Downing. I hope you'll have a good time following me throughout the journey of this course. This first post will focus on my expectations for the class. 

## What are your expectations of the class?
I expect to learn a lot about object oriented programming and C++. I hope to complete many interesting projects and gain more experience with the tools listed in the syllabus, and which I have personally encountered in industry.

## What did you do this past week?
We had an intro to the course and began discussing basic syntax and language features of C++. I was impressed with the structured/organized manner in which the lectures are run and my attention was fully captured by the lecture content. 

## What's in your way?
Nothing is blocking my progress in the course at this point. I am familiar with C++ and many of the developer tools mentioned in the syllabus. I am excited to get going in the course.

## What will you do next week?
I imagine we will continue discussing C++ basics and be assigned our first project. I will continue attending lecture.

## What's my experience of the class?
I have greatly enjoyed my time spent in class so far and look forward to attending more lectures. Professor Downing seems very knowledgeable of C++ and software developement and I hope to learn a lot over the course of the semester. 
## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is Github Pages, a way to host a free site directly from a github repository. I found a repository [here](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) which enables the creation of a personal blog in a matter of minutes.
