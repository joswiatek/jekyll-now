## What did you do this past week?
This past week I attended my first full week of classes and figured out how my weeks will look (busy MW and a light TTH). I've been making a real effort to continue exercising as my classes start up, and have been successful so far. I attended a proctor training wednesday evening. I also taught my first discussion section of the semester on friday. On the social side, my girlfriend and I went on a date to a drive-in movie.

## What's in your way?
Nothing is in my way this week, except for the constant time management aspects of life. I continue to use Google Calendar and Google Keep to start organized in my schoolwork, extracurriculars, and personal life.

## What will you do next week?
I'm doing a fitness testing evaluation Tuesday morning, so that will be a nice benchmark for partway through the week. This week is also LAN rush week, so I will likely attend a few rush events to meet potential pledges. I have a trip to a lakehouse with the Outdoors Club on for the weekend and I'm excited about that.

## What's your experience of the in-class exercises?
I have been enjoying the in-class exercises, particularly the Hackerrank exercise. Watching someone write code in class is useful, but actually writing code in class really helps cement my understanding of the concepts. I remember when I took OOP we sometimes did short hand-written code problems, but actually writing and compiling code is much better. I'd love to see more Hackerrank problems in class.

## What's your pick-of-the-week or 'tip-of-the-week?
My pick of the week is a Chrome extension called [Honey](https://www.joinhoney.com/). It automatically finds and applies coupon codes when you shop online at e-commerce sites like Amazon. While I've found Honey usually doesn't find any valid codes, it also has features to show the price history of an item so you can see if it's a good time to buy. You can also put items on a "droplist" and Honey will notify you if the price drops below a threshold you set.
