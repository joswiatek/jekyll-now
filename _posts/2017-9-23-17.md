## What did you do this past week?
This past week I attended classes and playd a lot of ultimate. I also attended meetings for student orgs and worked on projects for my other classes.

## What's in your way?
Scheduling difficulties between my partner and I are the biggest obstacle for the Voting project. We have made good progress when we are able to meet, but we both have very full schedules, so finding time is difficult.

## What will you do next week?
Next week I will have two technical interviews and I will complete the Voting project. I also have my first algorithms test on October 2nd, so I will dedicate some time to studying for that.

## What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class so far has been positive. The daily quizzes force me to review the material between each class, and while that eats up my time, it helps reinforce the material. I have been slightly surpised at how in depth the course has been technically, and I sometimes find myself wondering why we are covering certain material.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is [this blog post](https://emerywolf.wordpress.com/2017/09/20/using-google-timeline-data-to-create-location-heatmaps/) about using Google Timeline data to create heatmaps of where you've been. I exported my own data and was able to generate the following graphics.

My freshman year on campus:

My travels this Summer (I worked in Phoenix and made a road trip to San Diego, along with lots of national parks around Arizona):
