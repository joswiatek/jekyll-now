## What did you do this past week?
I attended my classes, observed a discussion section for TA training, performed a battery of tests for a fitness evaluation, celebrated Chinese New Year with my girlfriend and her family, attended a rush event (Bowling Night) for my fraternity, and taught a discussion section. I got a lot of work done on the Collatz project on Friday before going out for the evening. I went on a retreat style event to a Lakehouse with Longhorn Outdoors Club over the weekend before rounding out my week with an intramural soccer game Sunday afternoon.

## What's in your way?
Nothing is in my way so far except for the constant demands of managing a busy lifestyle. I've been able to keep up with all my projects and still find the time to workout 5 or 6 days out of the week. I've been successful in upholding my responsibilities and feel fulfilled by what I'm filling my days with, so I would say nothing is in my way.

## What will you do next week?
Next week I will finish up the Collatz project, finish my Computer Vision project, complete my TA training, attend a closed rush event (Smore's night), and hopefully get in a good squash session. I'll be driving up to Dallas this weekend to attend a memorial celebration (she wanted a "party" and not a funeral!) for my neighbor who recently passed following a heart attack.

## What's your experience of learning the basics of Python?
I enjoyed learning the basics of Python, even though I feel that already know the Python fundamentals. The refresher on how Python handles copy-assignment and deep-copying was great as it had been a while since I had thought through those concepts in Python. I also learned a bit about how immutable containers work in regards to hashing, and how an immutable container can contain a mutable container (the hash is based on the reference to the mutable container, and not the actualy data held in it).

## What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week is an [HTML script](https://instant.page/) that can "Make your site's pages instant in 1 minute and improve your conversion rate by 1%" by using **just-in-time preloading**. The idea is based on the fact that users often hover over links before clicking on them. This script causes the client-side browser to start prefetching the resources for a given link whenever the user hovers over it instead of waiting until they click on it. The result is that most clicks appear to load instantaneously, even over slow connections. This blew up on Hackernews, and you can read the comments [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19122727). I think this is something that could be valuable for my group's project as well!
