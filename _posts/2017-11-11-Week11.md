## What did you do this past week?
I had another fairly busy week taking an Algorithms exam on Monday, helping prepare an Operating Systems exam on Wednesday, taking a Business Law Exam Thursday morning, the OOP project due Thursday night, and grading Operating Systems exams all day friday. Friday night was date night, my girlfriend and I attended the Acapalooza concert, went out for frozen yogurt, and played some party games with friends. Saturday morning I slept in for what seems like the first time in months, and then did some grocery shopping/administrative stuff to organize my life, followed by a [Hot Ones](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAzrgbu8gEMIIK3r4Se1dOZWSZzUSadfZ) themed wing night/watch party in the evening. On Sunday I'll be exploring [Whirlpool Cave](https://www.yelp.com/biz/whirlpool-cave-preserve-austin) with the Longhorn Outdoors Club!

## What's in your way?
I'm feeling great about where I'm at right now, I don't have a lot of school responsibilities coming up next week, so I've been getting lots of sleep and getting healthy!

## What will you do next week?
Next week I have a pretty quiet week planned out. The main highlight is that I'll be purchasing a Macbook Pro 2017 on tuesday (my first Macbook!); I'm excited to enter the apple laptop ecosystem. Other highlights include a Big Data project and Algorithms homework. I may try to attend a talk with [Satya Nadella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella), but I'm not sure it will fit into my schedule.

## What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class has been positive. The Darwin project was interesting, although my group could have used a bit more direction on proper file structure in C++. We weren't sure if we should break different classes out into separate files, and exactly how the .h and .c++ files should have been laid out for this project.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is [Trello](https://trello.com/), a project management platform that focuses on flexibility and integration with other services to accomodate lots of different workflows while enabling productivity by creating minimal overhead. I am not currently using it for anything personal, but I'm going to seriously consider leveraging it for future personal and academic projects.
