## What did you do this past week?
This past week was a somewhat busy one, with one test and the third phase of IDB due. My group ended up spending a lot of time finishing up this phase, but we're proud of what we accomplished. I attended my class es and held office hours as per my usual schedule. I drove up to Dallas with my girlfriend for the Easter weekend, and it's been a great escape from my busy life in Austin.

## What's in your way?
Nothing is in my way! I have two projects due next week, but I feel confident that I'll be able to get them both done. A have a machine learning based computer vision project due Wednesday and an applied natural language processing project due Friday. Both will require a good bit of work, but I don't have a high load in any of my other courses, so I feel good about the week! I think I've settled into a good rhythm the past few weeks and feel good about the final weeks in the semester.

## What will you do next week?
Next week I will complete my two projects and hopefully spend some time cooking and working on my fitness! I haven't really been taking care of my body properly the past few weeks and I'd like to get back into the swing of things regarding healthy eating and getting some good physical activity every day. It's been difficult fitting workouts in when I spend most of my day on campus either in class or working on projects, but I realized if I just shift my priorities a bit my schedule will open up (see tip-of-the-week)!

## What was your experience of Project #4: IDB3?
Overall, I had a positive experience of Project #4. I think that the front-end development in this phase gave my group a bit of trouble because we weren't very familiar with front-end design patterns and so we flailed for a bit before settling into something that worked. After we got down a working pattern for the searching, sorting, and filtering components, it really only took a few hours before we had a rough implementation on each page. The changes to our backend took a bit of time as well but weren't too troublesome as we're pretty familiar with Python code.

## What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is this medium post about having a [lack of time vs a lack of priorities](https://medium.com/swlh/its-not-lack-of-time-it-s-lack-of-priorities-d67d8c3051e8). The main idea is that if you feel like you don't have enough time in your day, you're mismanaging your priorities and not your time. 

If your priority really is to get X done, then it'll happen before you do anything else. If you find yourself filling your day with tasks other than X, then X isn't actually very high on your list of priorities (or you're not being true to your priorities).

This change in thinking is something I've heard before but isn't really something I took to heart. I think that what the author said about "being busy is a badge of honor" holds especially true among high-achieving college students. It's easy to use "being busy" or "lack of time" as an excuse for not achieving our goals, but that's not productive in the long term. A better alternative is to honestly evaluate your current goals and allocate your time effectively to achieve those goals in whatever timeframe you set. 

I think this kind of self-improvement based lifestyle design is incredibly important and can yield huge benefits in most people's lives.
