## What did you like the least about the class?
Some of the lectures were over tools or topics that I felt I was already familiar with and so some days were a bit hard to pay attention to. There were little tidbits of useful info sprinkled in that I didn't know about, but on the whole, I didn't get much out of certain days of lecture. In regards to the projects, sometimes the requirements could be spread out between the class web page and random Piazza posts, which made it difficult to make sure we were fulfilling all the specifications. There were several times where we lost points even though we felt that we fulfilled all the requirements on the class web page because additional requirements/elaborations were posted on Piazza. That experience was frustrating and felt unfair.

## What did you like the most about the class?
I enjoyed the structured format of the lectures and the general format of the projects. I knew what to expect each day during class, and for the most part, the requirements of the projects were clear. Somewhat ironically, I felt like the purposeful lack of instructor support/disconnect with the lecture content allowed us to really just execute the project however we wanted as long as we stuck to the loose guidelines of tools and project structure. My team and I really enjoyed this freedom and had a fun time with the project phases. I think that this freedom also has the potential to become wildly frustrating if you hit roadblocks and are unsure of how to overcome them.

## What's the most significant thing you learned?
I wouldn't point to any specific tool as being the most valuable thing I learned, rather I would say that the overall engineering experience was the most valuable thing I took out of the class. I think (know from internships) that the experience replicated in this class is very similar to what a software developer working in industry lives every day. Going through the motions of researching a tool I'd literally never heard of before (ie, What is mocha/SQLAlchemy/insert tool here?) and then using it on a large scale project was really good practice for contributing to open source projects and completing assignments in my professional career.

## How many hours a week did you spend coding/debugging/testing for this class?
It depended on the phase, but on average I would say 10-20 hours a week. Most phases had one relatively light week and then a much busier week the 5-7 days before the phase was due.

## How many hours a week did you spend reading/studying for this class?
I didn't spend too much time reading/studying for this class. I would estimate 1-2 hours a week. As I said above, I already felt comfortable with most of the topics discussed in lecture, so I didn't need much extra time to be successful on the quizzes/tests.

## How many lines of code do you think you wrote?
I'd estimate that I wrote 5,000 lines of code, +- 2,000. It was definitely a lot.

## What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?
I'd never used AWS before, and used it heavily in one other class this semester simply because of how convenient it can be for group projects where we all need access to a shared web server or need a tool hosted somewhere. SQLAlchemy was also a really useful tool for this project, but I don't see myself using it often.

## What's the most useful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?
Our group heavily used Atom's teletype feature, which allows for collaborative development via screensharing. This was really useful when two people were working on the same feature and wanted to pair program in the same file.

## If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?
I would go over the entire plan for lecture topics during the first introduction lecture. That way, people could have an idea of where the class was going and could build better mental models of how the topics fit together. There were several weeks where I had no idea what we were going to be talking about because we had finished one topic and were starting a brand new one that didn't have an obvious connection to the previous.
