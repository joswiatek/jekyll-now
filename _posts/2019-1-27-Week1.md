## What did you do this past week?
This past week I moved into a brand new place as I was studying abroad last semester. I spent a lot of time catching up with old friends and working out what my weekly schedule will look like. I didn't have much school work yet, but I'm doing my best to stay on top of reading and assignments as they come up. I'm taking three CS courses as well as TA'ing and holding leadership positions in two student orgs, so I anticipate that organization and effective time management will be critical to my success this semester.

## What's in your way?
Nothing is in my way for success next week! I was a bit under the weather this past week and that impacted my productivity and hindered my ability to work out. I set a goal to run 1,000 miles in 2019 and I missed four days of running so I'm keen to get back on track.

## What will you do next week?
This next week I will attend my classes, turn in my first programming assignment, get a start on the Collatz project (hopefully it's released soon), teach a discussion section, attend a proctor orientation session, and attend two student org meetings. I will also run at least 5k every day and I anticipate any free time will be spent bonding with friends. Austin Bouldering Project celebrates their 3 year anniversary on Saturday so I may take advantage of the reduced rates for a nice bouldering session.

## What are your expectations of the class?
My expectations of the class are that my experience will be simliar to when I took Object Oriented Programming with professor Downing, with a few big differences. Given that the lecture material primarily concerns Python which I know fairly well, I think I'll have an easier time with the quizzes and initial project. The rest of the projects will be quite different from OOP as they are all large group projects. As with anything, I anticipate organization and time management will be critical to success.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or 'tip-of-the-week?
My pick of the week is the education youtube channel [Three Blue One Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw/featured). I discovered this channel while studying abroad last semester and found it very useful for understanding abstract mathematical concepts on an intuitive level. There's a LOT of content, but the series on neural networks is particularly good. There's videos on everything from cryptocurrencies to quaternions, and every single one is very well produced. Whether you're looking to get a primer on a new topic or want to refresh on something you learned a long time ago, I'd say this channel is worth checking out.
