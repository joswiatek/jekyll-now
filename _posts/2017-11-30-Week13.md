# The Home Stretch

We're racing towards the end of the semester, and wow has it flown by. Between a busy recruiting season, spending my first semester as a TA, taking a full course load, being an officer two organizations, and investing time into a serious relationship, this semester has been a blur of smiling faces and good times. For my final blog post, I'll be providing a review of the course, as I experienced it. Overall, I enjoyed taking Object-Oriented Programming with Professor Downing and would recommend it to others. I'll provide detail about the following features of the course: the **content**, the **workload**, the **projects**, the **tools**, the **resources**, and the **people**.

# The Content
The content is rich and the course involves an in-depth look at C++. Professor Downing is very knowledgeable about the workings of the language and was always able to explain concepts effectively and answer any questions. Lectures were consistently interesting and professor Downing did an effective job of introducing new concepts in ways that were engaging and easy to follow. Many lectures follow a natural pattern of introducing a problem and then slowly iterating towards a solution, making them easier to follow and understand. The content and lectures in this course are one of the high points and I would recommend every student in UTCS takes a course taught by professor Downing before graduation. 

# The Workload
While the course does carry a decent workload, I don't think it is unreasonable. I never got very frustrated with the projects, and always felt that I had adequate resources if I got stuck. Working with a partner is encouraged, and makes the later projects much more manageable. I would recommend planning your partners so you can work with people you know well for the final projects.

# The Projects
The projects are all interesting and relate in some way to the course content. Some are directly related (Allocator), while some seem unrelated but are best solved using design patterns discussed in class (Life). The projects helped solidify my understanding of concepts taught in class, specifically in reference to the different types of constructors and assignment operators using in the Life project.

# The Tools
The course is structured in a way to force you to use various tools in order to aid development and get full credit for the projects. Many make life easier (GTest, Github, Docker, Travis CI, make), while others seem useful but are not really explained or discussed much in class (Doxygen, Boost). I have used all these tools on personal projects and in industry, and think that the course gives a good intro to how modern software development should work.

# The Resources
The articles and sections of the book that I did read were interesting and helpful. One way in which I felt that the course could be improved is giving more effective answers on Piazza. In some instances, a direct question would be answered with a vague or indirect answer, resulting in frustration. If a student is asking for an explanation or guidance, then an explanation is appropriate. Sometimes a student would ask a simple yes/no question and be met with an explanation, and no yes/no.

The professor states that the project requirements are meant to be somewhat lacking in order to reflect reality in modern workplaces (which I agree is a good thing), but sometimes questions about the requirements are not clearly answered (which leads to frustration and confusion).

# The People
Ultimately, professor Downing cares a lot about his courses and effectively communicating useful information and skills. Professor Downing is animated during lectures and can sometimes be intimidating, but has good intentions at heart. I would recommend taking this course, as you get a lot of exposure to modern tools and effective workflows.
