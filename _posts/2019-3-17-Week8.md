## What did you do this past week?
This past week I attended classes, did stack checks, held office hours, taught a discussion section, studied for exams, and took three exams. I'll be spending Spring Break at a cabin in Oklahoma with some friends, so I looked forward to that at the end of the week.

## What's in your way?
As always, the only thing in my way is a lack of time in the day! I did start to feel a bit unwell early this week but was able to bounce back with vitamins and some extra sleep. I'm struggling a bit taking time off of everything for Spring Break, but it's good to spend some time away every once in a while.

## What will you do next week?
I'll spend the first half of Spring Break with friends at a cabin in Broken Bow, OK, and then the second half with my family in Dallas. I'll likely not be super productive in OK, but I'm hoping to get a lot done in Dallas the second half of the break. I have a natural language processing project to finish up, the SWE project to finish, and a few interesting ideas for personal projects relating to data science that I'd like to pursue.

## What was your experience of Test #1
Overall, I had a positive experience of Test #1. I was pretty comfortable with Python before the semester started, so it hasn't been too hard to keep up with the new concepts introduced in class. I've at least heard of most of the features of Python we've discussed, but definitely still had to spend some time studying to feel prepared for the test. I'm taking the class with a few friends, so we naturally studied together and all did well on the exam. I think the problems were a fair representation of the material presented in the course, and I think the grades should accurately reflect how well people are learning the material of the course.

## What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week is [EditThisCookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg?hl=en). It's a chrome browser extension that makes it easy to view and edit cookies in-browser without using the developer console or any external tools like Wireshark or Postman. I've found it useful both for security CTFs as well as debugging any weird behavior you're seeing from a website (sometimes you get left logged in to another account, etc.). If any groups are planning on using cookies with their website, this could be a useful tool!
