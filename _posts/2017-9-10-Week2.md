## What did you do this past week?
I've been quite busy over the past week, with coursework, TA'ing for CS439, officer meetings, and preparing for the career fair. I've also been trying out for the UT Club Ultimate team, and that's been eating a lot of my time.

## What's in your way?
The only thing in my way right now is a lack of substantial time to apply to this class. I did not make substantial progress on the project this past week but have made some progress this weekend.

## What will you do next week?
I will prioritize working on Collatz as the due date is rapidly approaching. I will attend the career fair on Thursday and hopefully will have to schedule around interviews in the coming weeks. We also have recruitment activities for my fraternity this week, so I will make an effort to put an appearance in at those events.

## What's my experience of the class?
I have been impressed with the practical approach to the class, particularly when contrasted with the Algorithms course I am currently taking. Everything in CS371p seems to be focused on getting work done and the course so far has definitely been reflective of my experience in the industry, as far as tools and workflows go.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com). It's a note-taking and reminder tool that I use to keep track of TODOs and action items in my life. I have labels for each of my classes and organizations, as well as statuses such as TODO, Blocked, etc. These labels allow for easy sorting (ie, "show me everything I have TODO before my CS371p class tomorrow"). You can also set reminders for events that have deadlines. The web interface and app integrate well, and using this tool has greatly reduced the strain of trying to remember everything that I need to get done. 

One thing that I've noticed personally is that TODO lists and agendas are only effective if you can make a habit of checking them and keeping them up to date. I've tried several approaches such as paper agendas, calendars, and even a simple text file, but everything always falls out of date and becomes more of a burden than a beneficial tool. Google Keep is easy to interact with and because of that, it has become a valuable productivity tool in my life.
