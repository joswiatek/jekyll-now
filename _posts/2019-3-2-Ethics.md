In this blog post I'll be responding to the prompt presented and discussed in class, show below:

The Suggestion Box:
Your first job after graduation is system administrator for a 200 person privately held
manufacturing company. The president/owner sends this message to the employees:
“I want to encourage each of you to make comments to me about any facet of
our operation you care to. Your response should be made through our
anonymizer program so that your identity will not be disclosed”
The president/owner finds one response saying:
“This company sucks. The only way I find to retaliate for the way I have been
treated is sabotage. Every tenth part I turn out is defective.”
The president/owner insists that you examine the computer usage records to
determine the identity of the alleged saboteur.


As I see it, there two possible decisions, each of which has multiple pros and cons. Note that there was a multitude of factors to consider for each position, and there isn't enough time or space to discuss them all here.

Possible Action 1: Reveal the anonymous commenter's identity.

In this course of action, I choose to follow my boss's direction and release who submitted the anonymous comment. If I choose to reveal the anonymous commenter's identity, I will preserve my own position because my boss will be less likely to fire me. This is an advantage for me, because I will preserve my own status, but it isn't necessarily the most ethical action.

The main ethical concern in this scenario is whether it's ok to breach the trust of anonymity that the comment was submitted in. When the commenter submitted their comment, they did so under the assumption that it would remain anonymous and their identity would not be revealed. This was guaranteed by the boss of the company himself, and so the employees of the company should have reason to believe they will remain anonymous. If I choose to follow the boss's direction to reveal the commenter's identity, I am acknowledging that it is ok for my boss to promise one thing and then change his mind and take another position. This makes taking this action unattractive, because I don't want to work in a workplace where I can't trust what my boss promises me.

Possible Action 2: Preserve the anonymous commenter's identity.

In this course of action, I will directly disobey my boss's direction and refuse to reveal the identity of the anonymous commenter. My boss will likely be upset and I will likely endanger my own employment. This is unattractive because I would like to keep my job.

The main ethical concern in this scenario is whether the contents of the comment overrule the boss's promise of anonymity. I think this is highly dependent on the industry in which the manufacturing company functions. If the gadgets which are being produced are critical to the function of some critical infrastructure or device, such as automobile or aircraft safety features, then there is a liability for the company if defective parts are being produced. If my failure to take action by revealing the commenter's identity would result in the deaths of innocent individuals, then I think it would be unethical to not reveal the anonymous commenter's identity.

These two paths of action both have upsides and downsides. However, I believe that there is a possible third choice of action that would both preserve the commenter's anonymity but ensure that defective parts are not produced. The company should put into place strict testing guidelines on the parts it produces, which should prevent any defective parts from being shipped. This would likely allow the company to determine the identity of the individual producing defective parts, without breaching the conditions of anonymity. I believe this is the best course of action.
