## What did you do this past week?
This past week involved getting back into the swing of things after Spring break. Most of my time went towards three big goals: finishing OS grading, completing my NLP project, and completing this phase of the SWE project. Aside from those things, I attended my classes, held office hours, and ran a few times. Overall, the week was a grind and probably my busiest week this semester. Although the week was busy, I'm proud of how my groups came together to finish our projects and produce polished results.

## What's in your way?
As per the usual, the only thing in my way is time. I think that over the past few weeks I've fallen into the routine of life and that could be slightly limiting my productivity. I need to start treating each new day as an opportunity to make progress on different fronts of my life, rather than a block of time to try to squeeze all my responsibilities into.

## What will you do next week?
This weekend consisted of some time relaxing at Round-Up events and catching up on some much-needed sleep, as well as catching up on small assignment and chores I put off due to the business this past week (like email and laundry!)

## What was your experience of Project #3: IDB2?
My experience of this phase of the project was largely positive, albeit more stressful than the last phases. I think my group works really well together and that is a huge asset. However, there was a massive amount of work that needed to go into this phase, and so even though we worked efficiently we still needed to put in a lot of man-hours. One thing that contributed heavily to the rush this week was that we didn't do much work before (or during) spring break. While that made this week more hectic, I think everyone in my group needed the break and it did a lot of good for our mental health.

## What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is [this hackernews thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19536375) about how researchers at Keen Security Lab at Tencent were able to "hack" the smart features of Tesla cars in various ways, the most prominent of which was causing Tesla Autopilot to drive into the reverse lane of oncoming traffic with small stickers placed in strategic positions on the road surface. Other things including gaining remote control of a vehicle's steering as well as tricking the windshield wipers into activating by showing a very specific image on a display in front of the car. Overall, the security team demonstrated that the level of complexity in the systems and neural networks used in Tesla's smart features creates weaknesses that can be taken advantage of both by traditional digital hacking and by creating adversarial examples in the physical world.

I think that autonomous vehicle technology has a lot of problems that will prevent effective implementation in the real world. For instance, consider if a prankster places a fake stop sign on the side of a highway. Human drivers would realize that the sign isn't real, but autonomous vehicles might create traffic jams. Now consider if the stop sign wasn't a traditional stop sign, but instead, an image specifically engineered to be interpreted as a stop sign by a specific neural network. Human drivers wouldn't notice the image, but autonomous vehicles could be tricked into causing accidents and unnecessary traffic.

The full paper is available [here](https://keenlab.tencent.com/en/whitepapers/Experimental_Security_Research_of_Tesla_Autopilot.pdf) and is well worth a quick skim.
