## What did you do this past week?
This past week I accepted an intership offer with Salesforce (yay!), studied for and took my first Data Exam, completed a Big Data assignment, attended the extra credit Under Armour lecture, did an outreach program at an elementary school, did 10 hours of design doc interviews for CS439 (the class I TA), managed design doc regrade requests for the last project for CS439, and took a mini-vacation Friday afternoon-Saturday morning for a close friend's 21st birthday party.

## What's in your way?
Currently nothing is standing in my way except the limitation of how much time is in a day! Having accepted an internship offer, I'm officially done with recruiting until next year, which is a great feeling. I'm really excited for what's in store next summer, and feel like my hard work and stress has paid off. I'll continue pushing myself in my academics, but will make sure to take some time to focus on my relationships with friends and family.

## What will you do next week?
This next week I will take an Algorithms test, complete the Darwin project, take a Business Law test, help prepare/proctor an exam for CS439, and grade the exam for CS439 all day friday.

## What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class so far has largely remained the same. I enjoy the discussions in class and I look forward to attending lecture. I feel like the quizzes are completely manageable, so long as you are attending class and paying attention to the material discussed.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is [this](https://crontab.guru/) website, which gives you human descriptions of when a crontab will run. For reference, cron is a unix service that kicks off a command at a specific, recurring point in time. It can be useful for generating backups, or running simple, repetetive tasks such as clearing your recyling bin.
