## What did you do this past week?
This past week I played in an IM soccer game, attended my classes, held an exam review session, took my first kinesiology exam, helped write an exam, proctored an exam, graded a lot of exams, attended an org meeting, and put in a lot of work on my group's SWE project. I also volunteered with Project Illuminate and CS Roadshow at ExploreUT. Overall, the week was busy, but I'm still staying on top of things. I didn't get to run as much as I would have liked to, but that's life!

## What's in your way?
Nothing major is in my way, except for my need to sleep! I'm managing to stay healthy while still fulfilling all of my responsibilities. My running routine did suffer a bit this week due to a lack of time, but I was able to put some good miles in this weekend and didn't lose too much fitness! I'm happy with where I'm at going into the final weeks of training before Longhorn Run. 

## What will you do next week?
This upcoming week I will finish up phase one of the SWE project, take a midterm, and complete my second computer vision assignment. It's going to be a bit busy, but I'm confident I'll get everything done. One thing that's somewhat out of the ordinary is a grading meeting for the class I TA for, but it's only for a few hours on one day. There's also a swing dancing mixer for my fraternity on Friday that I'm excited about!

## What did you think of the talk by Jesse on security?

I enjoyed Jesse's talk on security. I think that he was very knowledgeable on the subject, and it looked like he had a very well-designed course to offer. I think that his lecturing style wasn't particularly suited to the Socratic Method that Professor Downing using during his lectures. I didn't see anything I hadn't seen before, but security is one of those things that it's always good to have a refresher on.

## What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

My pick of the week is [Atom](https://atom.io/). It's a "hackable" text editor that does a great job of providing tools for editing a large number of languages. My team has been using it when writing our website in React, and we've been pleasantly surprised by both the built-in features and the community extensions. Some of our favorites include vim mode keybindings, HTML autocomplete, nice git integration (including visual highlighting and resolution of merge conflicts!), teletype (which enables pair programming on the same screen but with two different laptops), and a lot of nice themes! It's definitely an IDE that I would recommend!
