## What did you do this past week?
I had a very relaxing week, and spent a lot of time socializing and catching up with old friends. The big news of the week is that I purchased a new 2017 Macbook Pro on tuesday, so I've beens spending a lot of time playing with that and getting accustomed to the new ecosystem. I've really enjoyed the build and software quality so far, and am excited to start doing actual work on the new laptop. I also attended a jazz concert Friday evening and attended Friendsgiving, Painting with a Twist, and Birthday Party events on Saturday.

## What's in your way?
Nothing is in my way currently. I feel a little burnt out heading into break, but I should come back ready to power through to the end of the semester. I only have a few projects left and then several tests/finals to finish off the semester.

## What will you do next week?
This next week I will start the the Life project before Thanksgiving break begins. I will also complete my algo homework which is due Tuesday evening. I'm excited to take some time off from focusing on school to catch up with my family and spend some quality time with them over the holidays.

## What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class has been largely the same thus far. I'm excited to begin working on the Life project, and can't wait to start fleshing out a design and interaction between the different classes. I'm also excited to get to do some real development on my new Macbook.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/), a free online tool to generating pixel art and animated sprites. I've never been very interested in game development personally, but I know that one of the big hurdles is creating graphics (the overlap between people who can program and people who can draw isn't very big). This website make the creation of animated sprites pretty straightforward. If I decide to create a game in the future, I will definitely leverage this site.
