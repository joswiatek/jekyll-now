## What did you do this past week?
I attended my classes, played an IM soccer game (came out with a big DUB, woot!), attended a general meeting for an org, attended the second and final TA training session, celebrated Valentine's Day, caught up with a friend I studied abroad with, submitted Collatz, submitted a computer vision assignment, taught a discussion section, attended two closed rush events (smores night and a party-style event), and made a trip up to Dallas to attend a Celebration of Life for my neighbor who passed away a few weeks ago. Overall, it was a very busy week, and I was glad to have some time to myself during the drive to and from Dallas. I even managed to sneak a few runs in, so training for Longhorn Run is still going strong!

## What's in your way?
I have my first natural language processing assignment due this coming Wednesday, and to be honest, I'm a bit concerned with the status. It's a group assignment with very vague requirements, and I feel like we struggled to pin down a single task and as a result we're a bit scattered. Hopefully we can get some clarification from our professor in class tomorrow and all come together to create something meaningful.

## What will you do next week?
I will spend the early part of the week finishing my NLP project and possibly helping conduct bid interviews. The second half of the week will be a bit more free, as I already secured a full-time position and don't need to stress about career fair (I may still go, some friends and I discussed a resume-roulette game that could be fun!). After turning my project in Wednesday, I'm going to spend some time cleaning my room and tidying up my life in general!

## What was your experience of Project #1 (the problem, the overkill requirements of submission, etc.)?

Overall, I enjoyed Project #1, although I'm not sure I took away anything meaningful except for the addition of a few tools to my skillset (which is ALWAYS a good thing!). I've taken Object-Oriented Programming with Professor Downing, so I was familiar with the problem specification, optimizations, and requirements. The requirements of the submission did seem a bit overkill for the problem, but I understand and agree that practicing the process of "real" software developement is valuable. The project was pleasant to work on and didn't give me any headaches. :) 

## What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

My pick of the week is the [billing fiasco](https://boingboing.net/2019/02/17/etsy-sellers-say-their-bank-ac.html) regarding Etsy. According to Etsy, "a bill payment error affected a small group of sellers which resulted in some cards being incorrectly charged." Something went off the rails at Etsy and a currently unknown number of sellers were charged hundreds and thousands of dollars. A quick scan of the [comments](https://community.etsy.com/t5/Bugs-and-Technical-Issues/Etsy-drafted-395-out-of-my-checking-today/td-p/125258919) regarding the incident indicates that one seller was charged over $10,000, while many others were in the mid-thousands. Etsy is refunding all the erroneous charges, but as there's a bank holiday on Monday, it'll take until Tuesday for the money to transfer.

For a company like Etsy that is known for doing business with smaller artists, a breach of trust like this could spell trouble. Given that 40% of Americans can't afford a $400 emergency expense, I could imagine that an overdraft of thousands of dollars could force many sellers to leave the platform. Not to mention the potential impact that going over your credit limit like that could have on a credit score! 

While there isn't much concrete information yet, it seems suspicious to me that an "error" like this would happen on a Friday before a bank holiday. It will be interesting to see if there were malicious actors involved or if it really just was an innocent software error.
